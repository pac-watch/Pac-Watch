Welcome to Pac Watch! (@PAC_watch)
We are a twitter bot that posts the latest independent expenditures of PACs towards American Congressional and Presidential elections.

# Important Notes
We can not fully guarantee the accuracy of the information we report. This bot simply broadcasts campaign contributions as they are reported by OpenSecrets. We encourage users of our account to double-check any information they see with the official OpenSecrets or FEC websites. Campaign contributions are tweeted around the time they are reported by a PAC to the FEC. This means that our tweets do not reflect in real-time when a contribution was made, just when it was reported. Contributions can be reported in advance of or long after a made payment. This also means that our reported contribution amounts may not line up with those reported by other sources in the same time frame.

# FAQs
## What is an independent expenditure?
From the FEC website: An independent expenditure is an expenditure for a communication that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate and which is not made in coordination with any candidate or their campaign or political party.

## Where do you get your data?
PAC Watch reports data from OpenSecrets' API, which itself is derived from the OpenFEC (Federal Election Commission) API. We use the OpenSecrets independentExpend endpoint, which lists the 50 most recent PAC contributions and is updated 4 times a day.

## Can I cite you as a source?
Please do not cite PAC watch as an official source for any purpose. As stated above, we cannot fully guarantee the accuracy of what we post. Double-check any information you see on our page with OpenSecrets or the FEC's official website, and cite either of them instead.

## Why was PAC Watch created?
We believe that democracy is at its healthiest when citizens are well-informed about their politicians and political systems. We encourage voters to carefully monitor the money received by their representatives and consider the implications of such contributions.
